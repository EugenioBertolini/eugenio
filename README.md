# Verbose Introduction 

### BEWARE! Continue reading at your own risk.

I hail from Reggio Emilia, Italy, but have made my way to Tokyo, Japan, where I'm immersing myself in the fascinating world of Neuroscience as a student-researcher at RIKEN, specifically in the lab of adaptive motor control. Our research focuses on the fruit fly Drosophila Melanogaster, through which I am exploring the intricacies of neural circuits and behavior, all while pursuing a PhD at the University of Tokyo, expected to graduate in 2027.

#### 💼 Professional Interests and Expertise
With a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, my expertise lies in the realm of statistics, machine learning, and deep learning, with a particular focus on their applications in biomedicine and neuroscience. I am proficient in Python and have experience in embedded systems, enabling me to tackle complex challenges in these fields. My ultimate goal is to become a professor in biomedical or neural statistics, driven by my belief in neuroscience's potential to unravel the mysteries of human behavior and statistics' power to explain virtually everything.

#### 🛠 Projects and Contributions
While new to GitHub, I've embarked on several projects, including developing a tool to estimate energy expenditure from physiological biosignals, working on auditory BCI tasks with fNIRS and EEG, and creating a benchmark platform for calcium event detection with a GUI developed in TK. Currently, I'm working on projects related to decision-making principles in flies and generating synthetic human genomes, but I can't say much on that for now.

#### 📚 Learning and Development
I'm constantly seeking to enhance my skills, currently delving into WSL, mastering vim keybindings in neovim, and deepening my understanding of neuroscience, neural networks, and reinforcement learnings. My background in Biomedical Engineering, focusing on biomedical devices and analysis, lays the foundation for my research and academic aspirations.

#### 🌱 Looking Forward
After gaining valuable experience in experimental research, I'm eager to pivot towards theoretical work, aiming for a post-doc position or a teaching assistant role where I can contribute to the academic community and mentor the next generation of scientists.

#### 📫 How to Reach Me
Feel free to reach out at eugenio.bertolini@mail.polimi.it for collaborations, academic opportunities, or simply to exchange ideas on neuroscience, statistics, or any intriguing topic.

#### 🏞 Personal
When I'm not buried in research or coding, I follow my heart through various sports, finding my way back to hiking, mountain climbing, football, and running. I also dabble in playing the piano, embracing the challenge since 2022. Traveling fuels my soul, with dreams of exploring the landscapes of Chile, Argentina, Southeast Asia, and Iran.
